# MATLAB experiments
This folder contains the MATLAB scripts for the experiments in the paper. The scripts are organized as follows:

- `main.m`: The main script to run the experiments.
- `algorithms`: Contains the implementations of the four algorithms presented in the paper.
- `utils`: Contains utility functions used in the experiments.
- `tree-search`: Contains the implementation of the tree search algorithm used in the experiments.

To run the experiment for a specific algorithm, set the corresponding flag in `main.m` to 1. For example, to run the experiment for the Sophisticated Learning algorithm, set `run_SL = 1` in `main.m`.
