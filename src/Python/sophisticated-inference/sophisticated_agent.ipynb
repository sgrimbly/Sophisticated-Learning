    "   - Initialize the time counter `t` to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Begin Main Loop:**\n",
    "   - Continue if `t` is less than `t_constraint` and the agent is still \"alive\" based on resource constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Environment and Model:**\n",
    "   - Call `update_environment` to modify the environment and agent model based on the selected action, updating historical records of the agent's posterior beliefs and true states.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieve Current Beliefs:**\n",
    "   - Get the current belief state `Q` from `historical_agent_posterior_Q`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update Agent's Needs:**\n",
    "   - Call `update_needs` to modify the time since the agent last had each resource, based on the locations of resources and the agent's current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Observe Environment:**\n",
    "   - Call `get_observations` to receive the current observations from the environment based on the agent's true state.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Backward Smoothing:**\n",
    "   - If the current time `t` is greater than 6, adjust the `start` time for smoothing.\n",
    "   - Perform backward smoothing from the `start` time to the current time `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Check Belief Accuracy:**\n",
    "   - Print the length of the `historical_agent_posterior_Q` and its first element for debugging.\n",
    "   - Calculate the state prediction error and the agent's current position.\n",
    "   - If the prediction error is substantial or the agent is in a specific position, reset the agent's short-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Determine Planning Horizon:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the horizon for the tree search, considering the time constraints from the agent's needs.\n",
    "   - Ensure the horizon is at least 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Perform Tree Search:**\n",
    "    - Initialize the list of best actions.\n",
    "    - Execute the forward tree search to determine the best actions, considering the agent's beliefs, observations, and needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Record Chosen Action:**\n",
    "    - Append the chosen action to the historical record.\n",
    "\n",

    "    - A placeholder for future code to display or process the results of this iteration.\n",
